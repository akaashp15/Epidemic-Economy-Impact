# Epidemic-Economy-Impact

With the recent emergence of coronavirus, we wanted to understand the impact previous epidemics (such as SARS and swine flu) have had on the economy, including the stock market. We wished to see to what degree each industry was affected by epidemics. In simple terms, we wanted to see what industry to invest in during an epidemic. Through our findings, we hope to better educate the public about making smart financial decisions during an period of disease.
